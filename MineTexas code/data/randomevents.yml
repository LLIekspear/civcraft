# This file allows us to configure random events on the server.
#
# The following limitations are being enforced to reduce complexity(for now):
# - Random events can only have a SUCCESS or FAILURE state, not multiple options.
# 

# Here is an explaination of the various options
# id - unquie ID for this event
# chance - chance for event to occur, out of 1000. 100 = 10% chance.
# name - display name for the event
# message - message to display when event occurs.
# length - amount of time in hours to complete the requirements
# 
# The following sections are lists of components. Each represent and AND relationship
# this means all of them will be executed.
#
# actions - list of components that run when this event happens
# requirements- list of requirements that ALL must be completed to count as successful.
# success - list of components that run when this event is completed successfully
# failure - list of components that run when this event is failed.
#
#
# --- Components -----
# Each component has its own set of properties that are important to it.
# All component properties are strings and must have quotes around them.
# All components have a 'name' which must be unquie.
#
# I'll attempt to document available components here:
#
# SpawnMobs - Spawns in mobs when activated. 
#     where - location to spawn. Possibilities are TownChunk or CultureChunk
#     what - Entity name of the mob to spawn.
#     amount - Number of entities to spawn
#     spread - how tightly packed they should be when spawned.
# 
# KillMobs - Listens on entity death. If its the right entity and the right town, it registers
#     where: only register if entity is in this area.
#     what: only check for this entity name;
#     amount: total needed to be successful.
