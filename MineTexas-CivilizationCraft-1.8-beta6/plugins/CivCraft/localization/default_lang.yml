#---- debug string only, do not translate ----
welcome_string: "Welcome to MineTexas CivilizationCraft [%0] [%1] [%2]"

# =========================== String Formatting =========================
# This file uses ANSI encoding.
# In some of these strings, Variables may be present in varrying forms.
# Use the Above string as an example
# In code this is 
#       CivLog.debug(localize.localizedString("welcome_string","-Test-",1337,100.50));
# In the Strings file, it uses the formatting strings
#       welcome_string: "Welcome to MineTexas CivilizationCraft [%0] [%1] [%2]"
# And the output is as follows:
#       [CivCraft] [DEBUG] Welcome to MineTexas CivilizationCraft test 1337 100.500000

# Eventually, All strings that have variables will be replacing their counterparts in this file.
# I will try to denote them with the var_ prefix for the key.

# =========================== Generic Section =========================
#This is your currency name. MineTexas uses "RedBacks."
#Changing this here renames every instance of the term throughout the plugin.
#For instance, if you wanted the currency to be called "Niblits" you would set that here.
